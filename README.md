# Crowdfunding Data Analysis Project

## Background

During this project, I delved into the world of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which have been gaining popularity since the late 2000s. My task was to analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover hidden trends and insights.

Using the provided Excel workbook (CrowdfundingBook.xlsx), I modified and analyzed the sample-project data to identify market trends. I used conditional formatting to visualize campaign outcomes and percent funded. Additionally, I created new columns for Average Donation, Parent Category, and Sub-Category. Utilizing pivot tables and pivot charts, I analyzed campaign outcomes per category and sub-category - these visualizations can be found in the Stacked Column Parent Category and Stacked Column Sub-Category tabs.

To enhance the analysis, I converted Unix timestamps to normal date formats and charted this in the Line Graph by Date tab. In Microsoft Word (Module 1 Challenge Observations.docx), I crafted a report to answer specific questions about the dataset.

## Crowdfunding Goal Analysis

In this section (found in the Line Chart Outcomes tab), I explored the relationship between campaign goals and success/failure rates. I created a line chart to visualize the relationship between goal amount and chances of success/failure/cancellation.

## Statistical Analysis

I evaluated the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns, calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation of backers. I compared variability between successful and unsuccessful campaigns, determining whether the mean or median better summarized the data. This analysis can be found in the Successful vs Failed Analysis tab.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the world of crowdfunding, allowing me to uncover trends and patterns that can inform future campaigns. By analyzing the dataset and conducting statistical analyses, I gained a deeper understanding of crowdfunding dynamics and success factors.
